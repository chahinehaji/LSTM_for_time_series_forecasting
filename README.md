# LSTM for time series forecasting

In this repository I will implement a LSTM architecture for time series forecasting. We used heartbeat record as data.
<br/>
The data set can be found [here](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=ECG5000).
<br/>
All data used are under /dataset folder in the main repo.

## Requirements

Pandas 0.24.2
<br/>
Matplotlib 3.0.3
<br/>
Numpy 1.16.5
<br/>
Keras 2.2.5
<br/>
